### Vision - "MVC Quiz Game"

#### Background and problem description
For my MVC PHP project I intend to create a quiz game with no specific theme. There will be three or four options per question.

#### User / target groups
I have no specific age group or target groups in mind.

#### Marketplace
Nothing new or unique about a quiz game so no shot here.

#### Basic requirements / characteristics / Features / Unique Selling Points
1. User-friendly controls that are easy to understand.
2. User/admin can login to add/delete/update questions for the quiz.
3. Source code written in PHP with a focus on quality (well commented, indented, non repetitive).

#### Techniques
The techniques that I intend to work with are:
- MVC architecture
- PHP
 - Forms
 - Database (mysql/mysqli/pdo)
 - Session variables
 - More..
